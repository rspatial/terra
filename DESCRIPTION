Description: Classes and methods for spatial data, especially raster data. Methods allow for low-level data manipulation as well as high-level global, local, zonal, and focal computation. The predict and interpolate methods facilitate the use of regression type (interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial prediction. The user-interface is very similar to that of the 'raster' package; but it is simpler and faster. Processing of very large files is supported. See the manual and tutorials on <https://rspatial.org/terra/> to get started.
